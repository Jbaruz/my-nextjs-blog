## Overview

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of building a dynamic blog application using **Next.js**. It features a homepage, a blog listing page, and individual blog post pages where users can read posts and leave comments. The comments persist using the browser's local storage.

- **Dynamic Routing**:
  Each blog post is accessible through a unique URL, thanks to Next.js' dynamic routing.

- **Comments Section**:
  Users can leave comments on individual blog posts. Comments are saved to the browser's local storage and persist across page refreshes.

- **Responsive Design**:
  Styled with **Tailwind CSS** to ensure responsiveness across devices.

- **Clean Code Structure**:
  The project is organized with reusable components for maintainability.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## How It Works

### 1. **Homepage**

The homepage displays a welcome message and serves as the entry point for users.

- **File**: `app/page.tsx`

### 2. **Blog Listing**

The blog listing page displays a list of blog posts, each with a title and description. Clicking on a post navigates to its detailed page.

- **File**: `app/blog/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
    - Dynamically generated links for each blog post using Next.js' `<Link>` component.

### 3. **Individual Blog Post**

The blog post page shows the title, content, and a comments section for each post.

- **File**: `app/blog/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
    - **Dynamic Routing**: Each post is accessible via `/blog/{id}`.
    - **Comments**: Users can add comments, which are saved to `localStorage`.

### 4. **Navbar and Footer**

Reusable components for consistent navigation and branding across the site.

- **Navbar**: Provides links to the homepage and blog listing.
- **Footer**: Displays a copyright message with the current year.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Backend Integration**:
    - Connect to a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store posts and comments.
    - Use an API (e.g., via Next.js API routes) to fetch and save data.

2. **Authentication**:
    - Allow users to sign in and associate comments with their accounts.

3. **Rich Text Editor**:
    - Enhance the comments section with a WYSIWYG editor for formatting.

4. **Pagination**:
    - Add pagination for the blog listing page to handle larger datasets.

5. **Testing**:
    - Add unit tests and integration tests with Jest and React Testing Library.
